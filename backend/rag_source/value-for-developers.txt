At Boston Code and Coffee Software Developers may find value at our meetup doing one or none of the following: look for a better job, meet developers and make friends, validate the feasibility of an ambitious side project, get help with my coding blocker or homework, gain insight and awareness into a company you're interviewing for, learn about other professions involving code, join a vibrant online discord community, and/or hangout to sip coffee in a perfect space with friendly people.
