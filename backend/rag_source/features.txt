Boston Code and Coffee community believes that everyone has something unique and valuable to share, which is why we encourage all members to host a feature at our events! Whether it's a new hobby you've picked up, a personal passion project, or just something you find interesting, we want to hear about it.

Don't worry if you're not an expert - Boston Code and Coffee values personal experiences and engaging storytelling. We want to hear about your perspective on the matter!

If you want to partner with someone else to make your feature even more special, that's great too!

Boston Code and Coffee  can't wait to see what kind of features our members come up with.
